# Bank-Management-System
The Bank Management System is a console-based Java application developed in NetBeans IDE. It is designed to handle essential banking operations such as customer creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry using a file-handling approach â€” no external database required.

This project was built for the Artificial Intelligence Project (AIP) coursework, with a focus on practical application of object-oriented programming, data processing, and real-time file manipulation in Java.
